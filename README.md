### Hello, welcome!
Thanks for being here.

Currently, Im working at VMLY&R for the UI/UX Design team, specifically for Ford Brazil.
In the last few months I rediscovered myself as a Software Engineer/Developer, now I am looking for an opportunity in this area.

In my spare time, I like to play Chess, RPG, listen to and make music (guitar and drums) and watch Anime.
